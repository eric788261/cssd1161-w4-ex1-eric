# About me
# I enjoy weightlifting and Muay Thai. I also have 2 cats named Ash and Lucky.
# Goals for this course
# In this course, I aim to achieve better teamwork skills. I am often an individual learner and usually work better alone so I would like to practice working with groups as well. I aim to improve my problem solving skills as a group so I can apply these skills in my future job as a software developer.
